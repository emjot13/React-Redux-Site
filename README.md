It's a website that enables user to check lots of information about 
cryptocurrencies.
All needed data is being pulled from coinbase using their API.

For the project I used:
- React
- Redux
- Redux-logger
- Formik
- Axios

The project is organised according to ducks structure.
The main idea of the project was to get to know Redux.

Unfortunately the repository where I originally developed project was deleted 
and thus I don't have git history.
